# Cardivascular-disease-prediction

PROJECT SUMMARY
Data Description Demographic: Sex: male or female("M" or "F") Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous) Behavioral is_smoking: whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO") Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

Medical ( history)`

BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal) Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal) Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal) Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal) Medical(current)

Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous) Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous) Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous) BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous) Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

Glucose: glucose level (Continuous) Predict variable (desired target)

10-year risk of coronary heart disease CHD(binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”) -




PROBLEM STATEMENT

The cardivaascular data consists of set of columns that speaks about qhether the patient is suffering from heart disease or not

first we have to load the dataset and by understanding the datsaset with the meaningfull feattures and rows we perform the model

there are 3390 rows and 16 columns with in the dataset

age:Speaks about the age of the patient

education : shows the education thet the patient done in four different phases 1. schooling,2.intermediate,3.UG,4.PG

sex:Represents whether the patient is male or female

is_smoking:Represents whether the patient is smoking orr not

cigsPerDay:If smoking then how many cigarss the patient can atke per a day

BPMeds is there bp in thee patient

prevalentStroke is there any previous stroke in the patient

diabetes: Is the patient suffeing with diabetes

totChol :Total cholestrol

sysBP :SYStollic blood pressure

diaBP :Diastollic blood pressure

BMI :body mass indeex

heartRate :repesents the heart rate of the patient

glucose :glucose levels of the patient

TenYearCHD:Predicting ten yyear coronary heart disease with in the patient
